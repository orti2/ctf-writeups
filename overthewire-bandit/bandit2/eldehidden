### Links

- [Bandit Level](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit2.html)
#### Level Description
The password for the next level is stored in a hidden file in the inhere directory.
### Steps
---
We can see the directory that contains the we we are interested in by using the **ls** utility to see the contents of the current directory.
```
bandit3@bandit:~$ ls
inhere
```
Once inside the directory we can see that the ***ls*** command is not showing us any files or directories. The description says that we're looking for is here indeed. It might be hidden.
```
bandit3@bandit:~/inhere$ ls -a
.  ..  .hidden 
```
Now we see the hidden file, we can see what is inside by using the ***cat*** utility.
```
bandit3@bandit:~/inhere$ cat .hidden

```
And there is the flag!
